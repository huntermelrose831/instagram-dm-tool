# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

so this is what i want you to work on, i want the leads.jsx to look like this: i want it to say "Find Leads" at the top left, below that i want it to say in a smaller font "How do you want to find leads?" and then below that spanning from left to right but centered i want boxes that you can click. in the first box i want it to say " FROM ACCOUNTS" with the svg i used for the button on the navbar that takes you to the accounts page. in the next box i want it to say "FROM POSTS" and i want you to leave the icon alone i will add the icon myself and then i want you to leave the next 2 boxes blank and i dont want you to mess up the functionality of the leas page. the second box from the left should take you to the leads page that is being displayed now thank you
